# Background
This was a group project wherein we conducted detailed demand analysis of a 
company's portfolio performance, forecasted demand over a five year planning horizon, 
and then designed fulfillment and distribution centers to support its growth. 

My contributions to the project were the demand analysis and forecasting as well as 
visualizations used in the report (Tasks 3.1.1 and 3.1.2).
